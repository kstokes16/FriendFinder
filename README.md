## How it Works
* A user navigates to the survey form and answers 10 questions
* Each question is based on a 1 to 5 scale based on how much the user agrees or disagrees
* After submitting the form, the user is then told who their best match would be, based on who completed the survey and had the most similar answers

## How it Was Created
* Bootstrap
* Express
* jQuery
* NPM

### Other Cool Things I Used
* FontAwesome
* Google Fonts (I used Ubuntu)
